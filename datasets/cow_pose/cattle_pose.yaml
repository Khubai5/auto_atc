# Cattle Pose Estimation Dataset Configuration
# YOLOv8 Pose format for cow pose estimation with 12 keypoints

# Dataset paths
path: datasets/cow_pose  # dataset root dir
train: images/train      # train images (relative to 'path')
val: images/val          # val images (relative to 'path')
test: images/test        # test images (relative to 'path')

# Keypoint configuration
kpt_shape: [12, 3]       # number of keypoints, number of coordinates per keypoint (x, y)
flip_idx: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]  # keypoint flip indices (for horizontal flip augmentation)
